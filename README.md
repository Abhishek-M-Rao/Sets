# Sets
#Write 8 functions that are built to manipulate or read the contents of a set which is of an abstract data type. 
#Including remove, insert, check if an element is a member, check if a set is a subset of another.
#And find the union, intersection, and subtraction of two sets.
#All of these functions are written to be under O(n) time complexity.
